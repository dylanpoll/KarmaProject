# KarmaProject
This is my project to create incentive for student activity in my club.<br>
still under development this project uses a MERN stack and a discord bot. It also has a email bot in development.

The andriod app is designed in a way for modular use, there is a "main host service" input at login that is used to hook into the api allowing for people across the world to run unique configurations. This data can be saved for future log ins.
