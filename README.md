This project is being re worked into a react.js website instead in order to allow for cross platform interaction in a easier to maintain manner. This project will be picked back up and a large update will overwrite it when there is a initial stable release that covers the entire spectum of features that this version was working to cover. including a re vamp on the mobile app, website, discord bot, and database deployed and its routing mechanics.

# KarmaProject
This is my project to create incentive for student activity in my club.<br>
still under development this project uses a MERN stack and a discord bot. It also has a email bot in development.

The andriod app is designed in a way for modular use, there is a "main host service" input at login that is used to hook into the api allowing for people across the world to run unique configurations. This data can be saved for future log ins. 

if you plan on using this in your own club or otherwise, you will need to change out the contents on the AAurl.js file abd create a .env file.
